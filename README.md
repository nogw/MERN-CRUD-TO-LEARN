## project to study CRUD

in this project I create a type of public blog, with the option of creating a post with name, title, and content, and then, the blog admin can choose which post will be approved, as it is just a study
focused on CRUD I didn't create any form of admin authentication

## frontend routes

/ - create post  
/posts - timeline of all posts  
/post/id - show the post (if approved) based on its unique id  
/admin - approve and reject posts
